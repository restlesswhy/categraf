# urn - is a permanent identifier for specific data resource.
urn = "redfish/v1/Chassis/1/Power"
# prefix - the first part of the metric name to display.

  # name - the third part of the metric name to display.
  name = "last_power_output_watts"

  # prefix - the second part of the metric name to display.
  prefix = "power_supplies"

  # path - path to the required data in the json response body.
  #
  # You can find information about data search syntax here:
  # https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/blob/master/SYNTAX.md
  path = "PowerSupplies.#.LastPowerOutputWatts"

# In the example above, the metric would have the name:
#    redfish_power_power_supplies_last_power_output_watts_0
# At the end of the metric name there will always be a number that 
# indicates the ordinal number of the metric in the data array, 
# if it is in the path, if not, then the default will be 0.
